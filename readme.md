**Design Process Reflection:**

The color palette I chose for this base map was centered around shellfish in the Pacific Northwest, such as oysters and mussels. The cool, subtle shades of blue and green are reminiscent of the ocean waves and temperate rainforests found along the region's coastline. A hint of brown along estuarine regions corresponds with shellfish native habitat, rocky intertidal zones and mudflats. Because this map will be used for a research project, I kept the color contrast relatively low and mostly light to emphasize thematic layers that will be added later. I also deliberately kept most of the town, village, and island names in the map because some users of the finished product may be from small fishing and aquaculture communities, and I wanted to make sure as many people as possible felt included when using the map.
